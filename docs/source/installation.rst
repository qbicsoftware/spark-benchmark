Installation
============

The following sections will guide you through building the required docker images and setting up the spark network.

Requirements
------------

spark-service is based on docker containers and therefore needs docker installed on your machine.
All required containers will automatically be downloaded by docker compose. More details at `usage <usage.html>`_.

Obtaining the code
------------------

Clone the code from Github. Please mind the branches. If you want to work with the latest release always use the master branch.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/qbicsoftware/spark-service

Refer to `usage <usage.html>`_ for detailed instructions about how to run example scripts and your custom programs on the spark network.
